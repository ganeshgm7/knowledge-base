# What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines and systems that can mimic human intelligence. This includes tasks such as:

- Understanding language (e.g., a chatbot interpreting your sentence).  
- Recognizing images (e.g., detecting faces in photos).  
- Making decisions (e.g., recommending what movie to watch).  
- Solving complex problems (e.g., optimizing flight schedules).  
- Learning from experience (e.g., improving predictions over time).

In modern times, AI powers many everyday tools, from smartphone face unlock features to voice assistants and self-driving cars.

# Common Use Cases of AI

**Example**  
A “decision tree” algorithm deciding if an email is spam or not.

## Model Layer

**Role**  
Trains these algorithms with real data, so they can make predictions or decisions.

**Example**  
Training a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits (like in a bank check).

## Application Layer

**Role**  
The final layer where users interact with the AI via an app or API.

**Example**  
A face recognition feature on your phone unlocking your screen.

# History of AI

**1950s: Beginning of AI Ideas**

# Example of AI in Action – Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)

**How It Works**  
1. A document (like an invoice) is scanned or saved as a PDF.  
2. AI uses Computer Vision to "see" and identify text areas, logos, or tables.  
3. NLP techniques parse and interpret the text (like detecting supplier name, invoice amount).  
4. The extracted information is placed into a structured format (e.g., a database).

**Technologies Involved**  
- **Computer Vision**: Recognizing layout elements such as lines, boxes, or text blocks.  
- **NLP**: Understanding the meaning of text (e.g., "Total Due" or "Tax Amount").  
- **Deep Learning**: For more accurate and robust extraction, especially with varied document formats.

**Benefit**  
- **Faster Processing**: Reduces the need for manual data entry.  
- **Higher Accuracy**: Minimizes human errors in reading or typing data.

# AI Hierarchy (Umbrella View)

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
  The overarching field covering all techniques to make machines exhibit intelligent behavior.

- **Machine Learning (ML)**  
  A subset of AI where systems learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

- **Deep Learning (DL)**  
  A specialized form of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to handle complex, high-dimensional data.

- **Generative AI (GenAI)**  
  A part of AI that focuses on generating new content (text, images, music), often using advanced models like transformers (e.g., GPT) or diffusion models (e.g., DALL-E).

# Machine Learning (ML)

**What is Machine Learning?**  
Machine Learning involves algorithms that automatically learn patterns from data. Instead of writing code that specifies rules, you let the model figure out the rules by looking at examples.

**Why Use ML?**  
- **Adaptability**: The model can adjust to new data over time.  
- **Automation**: Saves humans from manually coding hundreds of rules.  
- **Better Predictions**: Often more accurate than rule-based systems, especially for complex tasks.

**Key Components of ML**  
- **Data**: Could be numbers, text, images, audio, etc.  
- **Algorithm**: The “recipe” or method (e.g., Decision Tree, Neural Network).  
- **Model**: The trained result that can predict or classify new, unseen data.

# Types of Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

Uses labeled data (each input has a known correct output).

### Regression

Predicts continuous values.

**Example**  
Predicting the price of a house given its size, location, and amenities.

### Classification

Predicts discrete categories.

**Example**  
Classifying emails into "spam" or "not spam."

### Detailed Example for Regression

Suppose you have data of houses:

| Size (sq. ft) | Price ($) |
|---------------|-----------|
| 1200          | 200K      |
| 1500          | 250K      |
| 1800          | 300K      |

The model learns the relationship between size and price. When you input 1600 sq. ft, it might predict a price around $275K based on learned patterns.

### Detailed Example for Classification

You have a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam. The model learns certain keywords (like “free,” “winner”) often appear in spam emails. Next time it sees these terms, it increases the chance it will predict "spam."

## Unsupervised Learning

Works with unlabeled data, discovering hidden patterns.

### Clustering

Groups similar data together.

**Example**  
Grouping customers based on buying habits into segments (e.g., electronics shoppers, baby product shoppers).

### Association Rules

Finds relationships between items.

**Example**  
Market basket analysis might find “people who buy bread often also buy butter.”

### Dimensionality Reduction

A technique in unsupervised learning to reduce features while preserving information.

**Example**  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can take dozens of variables and condense them into a few principal components.

## Semi-Supervised Learning

Uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data.

**Example**  
You have 10 labeled images and 1000 unlabeled ones. The model learns from the 10 labeled images first, then attempts to label or group the remaining 1000.

## Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Teaches an agent to interact with an environment by using rewards and penalties.

**Example**  
Training a robot to navigate a maze. Reward = +10 for reaching the exit, Penalty = -5 for hitting walls.

# Deep Learning

**What is Deep Learning (DL)?**  
Deep Learning is a subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers (often called deep neural networks). This structure helps in automatically extracting complex features from raw data.

**Structure of a Neural Network**  
- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data (like pixel values for images).  
- **Hidden Layers**: Each layer processes the output of the previous layer, identifying higher-level features.  
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final classification or prediction (e.g., "cat" or "dog").

**Why "Deep"?**  
Because there are many layers in the network, each layer learning more detailed/abstract features than the previous one.

**Applications of Deep Learning**  
- Computer Vision: Object detection, face recognition.  
- Natural Language Processing: Translating languages, summarizing documents.  
- Speech Recognition: Converting spoken words into text.  
- Generative Tasks: Creating new images, music, or text.

**Hardware Requirements**  
Deep Learning often requires powerful GPUs for parallel computation, since training on large datasets involves many matrix operations.

# Generative AI

Generative AI is a field where models create new, original content, such as text, images, music, or even videos.

## Key Architectures

### Transformer Models

Handle sequences of data (commonly text) by using attention mechanisms.

**Example**  
ChatGPT, which can generate paragraphs of human-like text.

### Diffusion Models

Involve a two-step process: adding noise to data (like an image) and then learning to remove the noise step-by-step to create a new image.

**Example**  
DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, which can generate artwork from text prompts.

### Multimodal Models

Process and correlate more than one type of data (e.g., text + image, audio + video).

**Example**  
A model that reads a text prompt and modifies or captions an image accordingly.

## Applications of Generative AI

- **Text Generation**: Summaries, creative writing, chatbots.  
- **Image Generation**: AI-generated art or realistic images.  
- **Video/Animation**: Generating short clips, cartoons, or enhanced visuals.

## Examples

- **ChatGPT**: Answers questions, writes articles, and creates code.  
- **DALL-E**: Creates images based on textual prompts (e.g., “a cat riding a bicycle in space”).

# Important Machine Learning Concepts

## Labeled vs. Unlabeled Data

- **Labeled Data**: Each example comes with a correct “answer” or label.  
  Example: A photo labeled “dog” or “cat.”

- **Unlabeled Data**: No predefined labels.  
  Example: A folder full of random images with no description.

## Structured vs. Unstructured Data

- **Structured Data**: Organized into rows and columns (e.g., databases).  
  Example: A spreadsheet of customer orders with columns like “Name,” “Item,” “Price.”

- **Unstructured Data**: No fixed format (e.g., text files, images, audio).  
  Example: Social media posts, scanned documents, emails.

## Neural Networks (Expanded)

Neural networks are built from artificial neurons that combine inputs, apply weights, and pass them through an activation function. Training (via backpropagation) updates these weights to reduce errors.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Great for image-related tasks because they learn local features like edges, corners.  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Suited for sequential data like text or time series, though now largely overtaken by transformers.  
- **Transformers**: Use attention to handle long-range dependencies in parallel, powering large language models (LLMs).

## Tokens, Embeddings, and Vectors

- **Tokens**: Smallest units of text, like words or subwords (e.g., “international” might become “inter,” “nation,” “al”).  
- **Embeddings**: Numerical representations that capture meaning in a vector space. Words with similar meanings have similar embeddings.  
- **Vectors**: Arrays of numbers representing data points (in text, images, or other modalities).

# Evaluating ML Models

## Metrics for Classification

- **Precision**: Out of all predicted positives, how many are correct?  
- **Recall**: Out of all actual positives, how many did the model catch?  
- **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall (harmonic mean).  
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table comparing actual vs. predicted classes.

## Metrics for Regression

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average of absolute differences between predicted and true values.  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Similar to MAE but gives more weight to larger errors.  
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: How much variance in the data is explained by the model.

## Bias and Variance

- **High Bias (Underfitting)**: The model is too simple, missing important patterns.  
- **High Variance (Overfitting)**: The model fits training data very well but fails on new data.  
- **Balanced Model**: Properly generalizes to new data without underfitting or overfitting.

# Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameters are the “knobs” you set before training (learning rate, number of layers, etc.). Adjusting them is called hyperparameter tuning.

- **Learning Rate**: How big a step the model takes when adjusting weights.  
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples processed before updating model parameters.  
- **Epochs**: How many times the entire dataset passes through the training process.

**Tuning Methods**  
- **Grid Search**: Tries all possible combinations in a systematic way.  
- **Random Search**: Randomly selects combinations to find a good set faster.

# Phases of a Machine Learning Project

1. **Identify Business Problem**  
   Define objectives, success metrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

2. **Frame as ML Problem**  
   Check if machine learning is indeed suitable. Sometimes a simple rule-based system might suffice.

3. **Collect Data**  
   Gather data from relevant sources, ensure it’s of good quality.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   Transform raw data into features that make learning easier (e.g., extracting "month of the year" from a date).

5. **Model Development**  
   Train different models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, neural network) and compare performance.

6. **Evaluate Model**  
   Test with a separate dataset and track metrics like accuracy, F1 score, or RMSE.

7. **Deploy Model**  
   Put the chosen model into production (could be an API or embedded in an app).

8. **Monitor and Iterate**  
   Keep an eye on the model’s performance, update or retrain it as data changes.

## Inferencing (Batch vs. Real-Time)

- **Batch Inference**  
  The model processes large sets of data at once, on a schedule (e.g., daily).  
  Example: Classifying all new emails received overnight.

- **Real-Time Inference**  
  Model predictions happen instantly for each new data point.  
  Example: A chatbot responding to user queries in seconds.

# Additional Topics in Modern AI

- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the sequence order.

**Why It Matters**  
Revolutionized NLP by enabling large-scale parallel processing and better long-range dependency handling compared to RNNs.

## Fine-Tuning

**Definition**  
Taking a pre-trained model (like GPT or BERT) and training it further on a smaller, task-specific dataset.

**Advantages**  
- Faster training compared to building a model from scratch.  
- Often yields better results on niche tasks.

**Example**  
Fine-tuning BERT on a medical text dataset so it excels at diagnosing patient symptoms from doctor notes.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Process**  
1. The model retrieves relevant documents or facts from a database.  
2. It then generates text that is more factual and grounded, reducing "hallucinations."

**Use Case**  
A chatbot with knowledge of product manuals. Before responding, it fetches relevant manual pages to craft an accurate answer.

# Why AI is Important

AI has transformed from a theoretical concept to a practical and powerful tool:

- **Saves Time**: Automates mundane tasks like data entry or sorting documents.  
- **Improves Accuracy**: Reduces errors in tasks like detecting credit card fraud or diagnosing diseases from scans.  
- **Solves Complex Problems**: Tackles challenges too large for manual approaches (e.g., climate modeling, astronomy data analysis).  
- **Future Growth**: As AI keeps evolving, it will likely integrate more deeply into healthcare, finance, education, etc., increasing productivity and enabling new innovations.  
- **Collaboration with Humans**: AI often complements rather than replaces human experts, handling repetitive or data-heavy tasks so humans can focus on creativity and strategy.
