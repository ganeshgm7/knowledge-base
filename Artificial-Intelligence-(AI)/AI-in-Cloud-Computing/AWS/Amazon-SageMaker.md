## Model Building

### Built-in Algorithms

SageMaker provides optimized algorithms for various tasks:

- **Supervised Learning:**  
  - **Linear Regression:** Predict continuous values (e.g., house prices).  
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classify data points (e.g., fraud detection).  

- **Unsupervised Learning:**  
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce dimensionality.  
  - **K-Means:** Cluster data (e.g., customer segmentation).  

- **Text Analysis:** NLP tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis).  
- **Image Processing:** Object detection and classification.

### Automatic Model Tuning (AMT)

**Purpose:** Automates hyperparameter tuning.

**How It Works:**  
- Define an objective metric (accuracy, recall).  
- Specify hyperparameter ranges.  
- SageMaker launches training jobs to optimize parameters.  

**Example Use Case:**  
Automatically tune learning rate and batch size for a fraud detection model.
