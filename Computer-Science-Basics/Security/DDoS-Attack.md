# DDoS Attack

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a website, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. The goal is to make the target system slow or completely unavailable to its legitimate users.

## Why Do DDoS Attacks Happen?

- **Disruption**: To disrupt the normal operations of a business or service.
- **Competition**: To harm competitors by making their services unavailable.
- **Political or Social Reasons**: Hacktivists may use DDoS attacks to protest against organizations.
- **Extortion**: Attackers may demand a ransom to stop the DDoS attack.

## How Do DDoS Attacks Work?

In a DDoS attack, an attacker uses multiple computers or devices (often compromised and turned into bots) to send an overwhelming amount of traffic to the target. Since the attack originates from many sources, it becomes difficult to block the traffic without affecting legitimate users.

## Types of DDoS Attacks

### 1. Application Layer (HTTP Flood)
- **What?** Targets the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model).
- **How?** Floods the server with HTTP requests, making it difficult to handle legitimate requests.
- **Example**: Repeatedly sending requests to a website's login page.

### 2. Protocol Attack (SYN Flood)
- **What?** Targets weaknesses in the transport layer (Layer 4).
- **How?** Sends a flood of SYN packets (connection initiation requests) to a server. The server tries to respond, but the attacker's IP addresses never complete the handshake, leaving the server waiting and eventually overloaded.
- **Example**: Sending a large number of SYN packets to a web server, making it unable to process legitimate connections.

### 3. Volumetric Attack (DNS Amplification)
- **What?** Uses a large amount of traffic to overwhelm the target.
- **How?** Exploits DNS servers by sending small queries that generate large responses, which are then directed at the target.
- **Example**: Sending a small DNS query that results in a massive response to flood the target.

## How to Prevent DDoS Attacks?

- **Increase Bandwidth**: Ensure the server has more bandwidth than needed to handle sudden traffic spikes.
- **Use DDoS Protection Services**: Services like Cloudflare or AWS Shield can help absorb and mitigate attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests a single IP can make in a given period.
- **IP Blacklisting**: Identify and block malicious IP addresses.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**: Filter and monitor HTTP requests to prevent malicious traffic from reaching your server.
- **DNS Filtering**: Use DNS filtering to block traffic from known malicious domains.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

## Conclusion

A DDoS attack is like a digital traffic jam where too many cars (requests) flood the road (server), making it impossible for regular cars (legitimate users) to pass. By employing a combination of strategies like increased bandwidth, firewalls, and DDoS protection services, you can protect your systems from such attacks.
