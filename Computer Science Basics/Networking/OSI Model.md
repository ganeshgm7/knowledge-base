# OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, created by the ISO in 1984, is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how data is transmitted over a network. It divides the communication process into seven distinct layers, each handling specific functions, ensuring that devices across different networks can communicate seamlessly.

## The 7 Layers of the OSI Model

1. **Physical Layer** (e.g., cable, hub, RJ45)
2. **Data Link Layer** (e.g., MAC address, switches)
3. **Network Layer** (e.g., IP, routers)
4. **Transport Layer** (e.g., TCP, UDP, port numbers)
5. **Session Layer** (e.g., Syn/Ack)
6. **Presentation Layer** (e.g., encryption, ASCII, PNG, MIDI)
7. **Application Layer** (e.g., SNMP, HTTP, FTP)

## Data Flow in the OSI Model

When transferring information from one device to another, data travels down through the seven layers at the sender’s end and then climbs back up the seven layers at the receiver’s end. Each layer adds specific information to ensure the data reaches its destination correctly, and these steps are reversed upon arrival.

### Example: Luffy Sends an E-mail to His Friend Zoro

#### Luffy Sends the Email

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7):**
    - **Function:** Luffy interacts with an email application like Gmail to write and send his email.
    - **Technical Details:** This layer uses protocols such as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to handle email transmission.

2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6):**
    - **Function:** The email is formatted and encrypted to prepare it for transmission over the network.
    - **Technical Details:** Encryption and formatting are handled by protocols like SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) for secure data transfer and MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) for email format.

3. **Session Layer (Layer 5):**
    - **Function:** A session (connection) is established between Luffy’s device and Zoro’s device, enabling the email to be sent.
    - **Technical Details:** Protocols such as PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) or RPC (Remote Procedure Call) manage the session, ensuring the connection is maintained until the email is sent.

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4):**
    - **Function:** The email is broken into smaller pieces called segments, each numbered to ensure they arrive in the correct order.
    - **Technical Details:** This layer uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable data transmission, ensuring all segments are received and correctly reassembled. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) might be used for applications where speed is more critical than reliability.

5. **Network Layer (Layer 3):**
    - **Function:** Each segment is packaged into packets and given an IP address to help route it to Zoro’s device.
    - **Technical Details:** IP (Internet Protocol) handles the addressing and routing of packets, while ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) assist with error reporting and address resolution.

6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**
    - **Function:** The packets are further encapsulated into frames, with MAC addresses added for identifying specific devices on the local network. Error detection is also performed here.
    - **Technical Details:** This layer uses protocols like Ethernet for wired connections or Wi-Fi (802.11) for wireless connections. PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) may be used for direct connections, such as dial-up.

7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1):**
    - **Function:** The frames are converted into bits and transmitted as electrical, optical, or radio signals over the physical medium.
    - **Technical Details:** This layer includes the actual hardware and physical mediums like Ethernet cables, fiber optics, or radio waves for Wi-Fi. Protocols like RS-232 can be used for serial communication.

#### Zoro Receives the Email

When Zoro receives the email, the process is reversed:

- **Physical Layer:** Zoro’s device receives the signals and converts them back into frames.
- **Data Link Layer:** The frames are checked for errors, and MAC addresses are processed.
- **Network Layer:** The IP packets are extracted and routed to the correct destination within Zoro’s device.
- **Transport Layer:** Segments are reassembled in the correct order, and any errors are corrected.
- **Session Layer:** The session is managed, and the connection is maintained or closed as needed.
- **Presentation Layer:** The email is decrypted and formatted for display.
- **Application Layer:** Zoro views the email in his Gmail application.
