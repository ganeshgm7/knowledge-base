# Understanding Value Types in C# and Their Memory Allocation

## üìå What Are Value Types?

In C#, Value Types are types that hold the actual data directly rather than a reference to the data. This is in contrast to Reference Types, which store a reference (or pointer) to the actual data on the heap.

**Key Concept:** When you assign a value type to another, a copy of the data is made.

## üß¨ Common Value Types in C#

All value types derive from `System.ValueType`. Here are some common examples:

- Numeric types: `int`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, `byte`, `long`, `short`
- Boolean: `bool`
- Char: `char`
- Structs: Any custom struct
- Enumerations: `enum`

## üì¶ Where Are Value Types Stored? Stack vs. Heap

### ‚úÖ Stack: Primary Home of Value Types

Value types are typically stored on the stack when:

- They are local variables inside a method.
- They are passed by value.
- They are part of a method call or temporary computation.

> The stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) memory structure.  
> Stack allocation is fast and deterministic, and memory is released automatically when the method call ends.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Heap: When Value Types End Up on the Heap

While value types are generally stored on the stack, they may end up on the heap in certain cases:

- When part of a reference type (e.g., a field in a class).
- When boxed (i.e., cast to an object or interface).
- When captured by a closure or lambda expression.

## üß± Memory Layout and Allocation for Value Types

### üîπ Stack Allocation Example

```
void Method() {
    int x = 42;
    int y = x; // Copy is made; x and y are independent
}
```

- `x` is allocated on the stack.
- `y = x;` makes a bit-by-bit copy of the value.
- Both `x` and `y` have separate memory addresses on the stack.

### üß† How Memory Addresses Work in Stack (Simplified)

Here‚Äôs a conceptual view of what the stack might look like:

| Variable | Memory Address | Value |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| x        | 0x0012FF4C     | 42    |
| y        | 0x0012FF48     | 42    |

Even though `y = x;`, they point to different stack locations.  
Changing `y` later won‚Äôt affect `x`.

You can see these memory addresses by using unsafe code (not recommended for production):

```
unsafe {
    int a = 10;
    int b = a;

    Console.WriteLine((int)&a);
    Console.WriteLine((int)&b);
}
```

### üî∏ Heap Allocation via Boxing

```
int a = 100;
object obj = a; // Boxing: a copy of 'a' is placed on the heap
```

Boxing converts a value type to reference type.  
A new heap object is created, and the value is copied into it.

## üß≥ Stack vs Heap: Key Differences

| Feature              | Stack                    | Heap                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Allocation speed     | Very fast                | Slower                    |
| Memory release       | Automatic (method ends)  | Managed by GC             |
| Scope                | Local to method          | Global/long-lived         |
| Lifetime             | Short-lived              | Variable                  |
| Access speed         | Faster                   | Slower                    |
| Use for Value Types  | Default location         | When boxed or part of class |

## üí¨ Structs ‚Äì Custom Value Types

### Defining a Struct:

```
struct Point {
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}
```

### Behavior:

```
Point p1 = new Point { X = 10, Y = 20 };
Point p2 = p1;
p2.X = 30;

Console.WriteLine(p1.X); // Output: 10 (copy made)
```

- `Point` is a value type.
- `p2 = p1;` creates a deep copy (new memory on the stack).
- Changes to `p2` don‚Äôt affect `p1`.

### Stack Visualization for Struct:

| Variable | Memory Address | Value (X, Y) |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| p1       | 0x0012FF3C     | (10, 20)     |
| p2       | 0x0012FF34     | (30, 20)     |

## üéÅ Boxing and Unboxing

Boxing and unboxing are performance-critical operations when dealing with value types.

## üîÅ Passing Value Types

### ‚úÖ Pass by Value (Default)

```
void Change(int a) {
    a = 10;
}
```

- A copy of `a` is passed to the method.
- The original variable remains unchanged.

### üîÑ Pass by Reference

```
void Change(ref int a) {
    a = 10;
}
```

- The method receives a reference to the original memory location.
- Changes inside the method persist outside.

### Stack Memory Address Behavior:

| Variable          | Address       | Value   |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| a (original)      | 0x0012FF10    | 5       |
| a (inside method) | Same as above (if ref) | Updated |

> If passed without `ref`, a copy is created at a different address.

## üß† Final Thoughts

Understanding how value types behave in terms of memory, copying, stack addresses, and heap interactions is essential for writing performant and predictable code in C#. Always remember:

- Value types are copied by value, not by reference (unless explicitly passed with `ref` or `out`).
- Each variable gets a unique memory address on the stack.
- Avoid unnecessary boxing/unboxing.
- Structs should be lightweight, or passed by reference if large.
- Use the stack for short-lived values and heap (via classes) for shared or long-lived data.

# Understanding Reference Types in C# and Their Memory Allocation

## üìå What Are Reference Types?

In C#, Reference Types store a reference (or pointer) to the actual data, which is located on the heap. The variable itself (the reference or address) is stored on the stack.

**Key Concept:** When you assign one reference type variable to another, both variables point to the same object in memory.

## üß¨ Common Reference Types in C#

All reference types derive from `System.Object`. Here are typical examples:

- Classes: `class`, `string`, `object`
- Arrays
- Interfaces
- Delegates
- Dynamic types

## üì¶ Where Are Reference Types Stored?

### üìå Dual Location: Stack & Heap

When you create a reference type:

- The **reference (address)** is stored on the stack.
- The **actual object/data** is stored on the heap.

## üîÅ How Assignment Works

```
class Person {
    public string Name;
}

void Main() {
    Person p1 = new Person();
    p1.Name = "Alice";
    Person p2 = p1;
    p2.Name = "Bob";

    Console.WriteLine(p1.Name); // Output: Bob
}
```

- `p1` and `p2` both refer to the same memory location on the heap.
- Changing `p2.Name` affects `p1.Name`, because they point to the same object.

## üì¶ How Stack and Heap Work Together for Reference Types

| Memory Component | Role with Reference Types                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Stack            | Stores the reference/pointer to the object |
| Heap             | Stores the actual object/data              |
| Reference        | Acts like a memory address pointing to heap object |

## üß± Memory Layout Example: Reference Type

```
class Car {
    public string Model;
    public int Year;
}

void Main() {
    Car c1 = new Car { Model = "BMW", Year = 2022 };
    Car c2 = c1;
    c2.Model = "Audi";
}
```

### üß† Stack and Heap Representation

**Stack:**

| Variable | Address     | Value (Reference)     |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| c1       | 0x0012FF1C  | 0x005C3098 (heap ref) |
| c2       | 0x0012FF18  | 0x005C3098            |

**Heap:**

| Address     | Object                              |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0x005C3098  | `Car { Model="Audi", Year=2022 }`   |

Both `c1` and `c2` point to the same Car object in heap memory.  
Only the reference is copied, not the actual object.

## üß† Assignment Behavior: Reference vs Value

| Action        | Value Type              | Reference Type                  |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Assignment    | Copies the value        | Copies the reference            |
| Modification  | Independent (after copy)| Affects original (same object)  |
| Equality (==) | Compares values         | Compares references (unless overridden) |

## üßπ Garbage Collection and Reference Types

The Garbage Collector (GC) manages memory in the heap.  
When there are no more references to an object, GC will clean it up.

```
void Main() {
    Person p = new Person(); // heap allocation
    p = null;                // reference removed
}
// At this point, the object is unreachable and GC can clean it
```

## üì¶ Reference Types Inside Reference Types

```
class Engine {
    public int HorsePower;
}

class Car {
    public Engine Engine;
}

void Main() {
    Car car = new Car { Engine = new Engine { HorsePower = 150 } };
}
```

- The `car` object is on the heap.
- Inside it, the `Engine` object is also on the heap.
- The stack only holds the reference to `car`.

## üßæ Reference Type Characteristics

| Characteristic       | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Memory location      | Object is on heap; reference is on stack         |
| Managed by GC        | Yes                                              |
| Assignment behavior  | Reference copied (not the object)                |
| Mutability           | Often mutable (depends on class definition)      |
| Inheritance          | Supports full inheritance and polymorphism       |
| Default value        | `null`                                           |
| Comparison           | By reference (`==`), unless overridden (`Equals`)|

## üì¶ Stack + Heap Summary (Side-by-side)

| Operation                  | Stack                    | Heap                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Object creation            | Stores pointer to heap   | Stores object instance        |
| Assignment (`p2 = p1`)     | New reference to object  | No new object created         |
| null assignment            | Clears reference         | Object becomes eligible for GC|
| Modification via reference | Updates shared object    | Reflected across all references|

## üß† Memory Address Behavior (Simplified View)

```
class Demo {
    public int Value;
}

void Main() {
    Demo d1 = new Demo();
    Demo d2 = d1;
    d2.Value = 50;
}
```

| Variable | Stack Address | Heap Address  | Object Value |
|----------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| d1       | 0x0012FF1C     | 0x005C40F0    | Value = 50   |
| d2       | 0x0012FF18     | 0x005C40F0    | Value = 50   |

Both `d1` and `d2` point to the same object on the heap.  
So any change via one is visible via the other.

## üîÅ Passing Reference Types to Methods

### ‚ûï Pass by Value (Default)

```
void UpdateName(Person p) {
    p.Name = "Charlie";
}
```

- The reference is passed by value.
- The method can modify the object, but not reassign it outside.

### üîÑ Pass by Reference (`ref`)

```
void ChangeRef(ref Person p) {
    p = new Person { Name = "Diana" };
}
```

- The reference itself is passed by reference.
- Reassignment inside the method affects the caller‚Äôs variable.

# üß± What is Boxing?

Boxing is the process of converting a value type (like `int`, `float`, `bool`, etc.) into an object type.  
This wraps the value in a reference type and stores it on the heap.

> üîÅ It's like putting a value type inside a box (object) so it can be treated like a reference type.

## ‚úÖ Simple Example of Boxing

```
int number = 123;        // value type
object obj = number;     // boxing: number is copied to heap and wrapped as an object

Console.WriteLine(obj);  // Output: 123
```

### üîç What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- `number` is stored on the stack.
- `obj` is a reference stored on the stack that points to a heap object containing the value `123`.

---

# üì§ What is Unboxing?

Unboxing is the reverse of boxing. It extracts the value type from the object.

> üîÅ Think of it as taking the value out of the box and putting it back on the stack.

## ‚úÖ Simple Example of Unboxing

```
object obj = 123;        // boxing
int number = (int)obj;   // unboxing: value is copied from heap to stack

Console.WriteLine(number); // Output: 123
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Unboxing requires **explicit casting**, and if the cast is incorrect, it will throw an exception.

## üîÑ Full Example: Boxing and Unboxing Together

```
int value = 42;              // value type
object boxed = value;        // boxing

Console.WriteLine(boxed);    // Output: 42

int unboxed = (int)boxed;    // unboxing
Console.WriteLine(unboxed);  // Output: 42
```

---

## üö® Why Is It Important?

- **Boxing** creates a new object on the heap ‚Äî it's relatively slow and adds memory overhead.
- **Unboxing** involves type checking and a copy ‚Äî also adds cost.
- In performance-critical code (like in games or real-time systems), **avoid frequent boxing/unboxing**.

## ‚ùå Common Pitfall Example

```
object obj = 123;
double d = (double)obj; // ‚ùå InvalidCastException
```

You can only unbox into the original value type used during boxing.

### ‚úÖ To fix it:

```
int i = (int)obj;      // ‚úÖ Correct
double d = i;          // ‚úÖ Then convert if needed
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Operation | Description                      | Location        |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Boxing    | Value ‚Üí Object (wrapped, heap)   | Stack ‚Üí Heap    |
| Unboxing  | Object ‚Üí Value (unwrap, copy)    | Heap ‚Üí Stack    |

# The Immutability of Strings in C#

## What is Immutability?

In C#, a string is a reference type, yet it is immutable. This means that once a string object is created, it cannot be modified. Any operation that seems to alter a string (such as concatenation, replacement, or trimming) actually creates a new string object in memory, rather than changing the existing one.

## Example: Immutability in Action

```
string s1 = "Original string";
string s2 = s1;

s1 = "Modified string";

Console.WriteLine($"s1 : {s1}");  // Output: Modified string
Console.WriteLine($"s2 : {s2}");  // Output: Original string
```

**Explanation:**

- `s1` is initially assigned the value `"Original string"`.
- `s2` is then assigned the value of `s1`, which means both `s1` and `s2` reference the same string object at this point.
- When `s1` is reassigned to `"Modified string"`, it no longer points to the original string. Instead, a new string object is created in memory and assigned to `s1`.
- Meanwhile, `s2` continues to point to the original string, `"Original string"`.

‚úÖ This clearly demonstrates that strings are immutable‚Äîmodifying `s1` does not affect `s2`.

## Memory Implications of String Immutability

**Key Point:**  
Every modification to a string (such as `+=`) allocates a new memory space for the resulting string. The previous string object becomes eligible for garbage collection, assuming there are no other references to it.

This behavior can lead to performance overhead, particularly when performing numerous string operations in a loop or high-frequency context.

## Illustration: Multiple String Modifications

```
string s1 = "Hello World! ";
s1 += "Programming ";
s1 += "is ";
s1 += "fun.";
Console.WriteLine(s1);  // Output: Hello World! Programming is fun.
```

**Explanation:**

- Each use of the `+=` operator creates a new string object behind the scenes.
- So effectively, the memory is being re-allocated with each concatenation.
- Over time, especially in loops, this leads to many temporary string objects being created and discarded.

üß† **Implication:** Inefficient memory usage and potentially reduced application performance.

## The String Intern Pool

### What is Interning?

To mitigate memory waste, C# uses a mechanism called the **String Intern Pool**. This pool stores unique string literals. When the same literal is declared again, the runtime reuses the reference from the pool instead of creating a new string object.

## Example: String Intern Pool in Use

```
string a = "Example";   // Allocates new space if not in the pool.
string b = "Example";   // Returns reference to the same space in the pool.
string c = "Different"; // Allocates new space as it's not in the pool.
```

**Explanation:**

- Both `a` and `b` refer to the same literal `"Example"` and thus share the same memory reference from the intern pool.
- `c` is a different literal, so it gets its own memory allocation.

üîç You can even verify this using `Object.ReferenceEquals(a, b)` ‚Äî it will return `true`.

‚úÖ **Advantage:** Optimizes memory by preventing multiple allocations for identical literals.

## Using StringBuilder for Mutable String Operations

### Why Use StringBuilder?

If your application needs to perform extensive and frequent modifications to strings, using the `StringBuilder` class from the `System.Text` namespace is recommended.

Unlike `string`, `StringBuilder` is a **mutable** type, allowing modifications without creating new objects every time.

## Advantages of Using StringBuilder

‚úÖ **Efficient Text Manipulation**  
StringBuilder modifies the existing buffer instead of creating new string instances.

‚úÖ **Better Performance**  
Especially useful in loops or large concatenation operations.  
Significantly reduces memory allocations and garbage collection overhead.

## Example: StringBuilder in Practice

```
using System.Text;

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello World! ");
sb.Append("Programming ");
sb.Append("is ");
sb.Append("fun.");
Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());  // Output: Hello World! Programming is fun.
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Append` method adds to the current content of the `StringBuilder` instance.
- All modifications happen on the same object, avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.
- `sb.ToString()` returns the final string result when needed.

üöÄ This approach is highly performant for string manipulation-heavy tasks.

## Conclusion

Understanding the immutable nature of strings in C# and its memory management implications is crucial for writing optimized applications. Here‚Äôs a quick summary:

| **Concept**                  | **Behavior / Implication**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strings are immutable        | Every modification creates a new string object.                                            |
| Memory overhead              | Frequent changes lead to multiple allocations, which may degrade performance.              |
| String Intern Pool           | Saves memory by reusing identical string literals.                                         |
| Use StringBuilder when needed| For frequent modifications, prefer `StringBuilder` to avoid unnecessary allocations.       |

# üìò Immutability in C# Objects

---

### üî∑ What is Immutability?

In C#, **immutability** means creating objects whose **state cannot change after they are created**.

- All values are set **once** during construction.
- The object does **not expose any way** to change its internal data.
- If you need a modified version, you **create a new object**.

---

### üî∑ Why Use Immutable Objects?

| Benefit              | Description                                                             |

| ‚úÖ Thread Safety      | No need for locks ‚Äì safe to share between threads.                     |
| ‚úÖ Predictable Code   | State doesn‚Äôt change unexpectedly, making it easier to understand.     |
| ‚úÖ Fewer Bugs         | Prevents accidental changes or side effects.                           |

### üî∑ How to Make a Class Immutable in C#

To make an object immutable in C#, follow these rules:

- **Use `readonly` fields (or `get`-only properties)**  
  ‚û§ Fields can only be assigned in the constructor.

- **Do not use setters (`set;`)**  
  ‚û§ Only `get;` properties are allowed.

- **Initialize all values through the constructor**  
  ‚û§ Ensures the object is always fully initialized and valid.

- **Do not expose methods that mutate the state**  
  ‚û§ Use "copy" methods like `WithXyz()` that return a new object.

---

### üî∑ Example: Immutable `Student` Class

```
public class Student
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public int Age { get; }

    public Student(string name, int age)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(name))
            throw new ArgumentException("Name is required.", nameof(name));
        if (age < 0)
            throw new ArgumentException("Age cannot be negative.", nameof(age));

        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    // Returns a new object with updated name
    public Student WithName(string newName)
    {
        return new Student(newName, this.Age);
    }

    // Returns a new object with updated age
    public Student WithAge(int newAge)
    {
        return new Student(this.Name, newAge);
    }
}
```

---

### üî∑ Usage Example

```
var student1 = new Student("Alice", 20);

// Create a new object with updated age
var student2 = student1.WithAge(21);

Console.WriteLine(student1.Age); // Output: 20
Console.WriteLine(student2.Age); // Output: 21
```

- `student1` remains unchanged.
- `student2` is a **new object** with a different age.

# `==` vs `.Equals()` in C#

In C#, we often need to compare two values or objects to see if they're the same. For that, we use either the `==` operator or the `.Equals()` method. Although they seem similar, they behave differently based on the type of data being compared ‚Äî especially when it comes to **value types** vs **reference types**.

---

### `==` Operator

- This is an **operator**, meaning it can be **overloaded** to behave differently for different types.
- For **value types** (like `int`, `float`, `bool`, `char`, etc.), it compares the **actual values**.
- For **reference types** (like classes, arrays, objects), it compares **object references** (i.e., are they the same object in memory?) ‚Äî unless the type overloads the `==` operator.

### `.Equals()` Method

- This is a **method** defined in the base `System.Object` class.
- It can be **overridden** to implement custom comparison logic.
- For **value types**, it compares **values**.
- For **reference types**, by default, it compares **object references** ‚Äî unless overridden.
- Unlike `==`, calling `.Equals()` on a `null` object throws a `NullReferenceException`.

---

## üß™ Real-Life Examples

Let‚Äôs walk through different use cases to understand how both work in practice.

---

### Value Types ‚Äì Behave the Same

```
int a = 5;
int b = 5;

Console.WriteLine(a == b);        // True
Console.WriteLine(a.Equals(b));   // True
```

With simple types like integers, both `==` and `.Equals()` compare **actual values**, so both return `true`.

---

### Reference Types ‚Äì Different Instances vs Same Reference

```
class Person {
    public string Name;
}

Person p1 = new Person { Name = "Alice" };
Person p2 = new Person { Name = "Alice" };

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2);        // False ‚Äì different objects in memory
Console.WriteLine(p1.Equals(p2));   // False ‚Äì default Equals() compares reference

Person p3 = p1;

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p3);        // True ‚Äì both point to the same object
Console.WriteLine(p1.Equals(p3));   // True ‚Äì same object, so Equals returns true
```

#### üîç What‚Äôs Happening Here?

- `p1` and `p2` are two **separate instances** of the `Person` class, even though they have the same data (`Name = "Alice"`). Since they are different objects in memory:
  - `p1 == p2` ‚Üí `false`
  - `p1.Equals(p2)` ‚Üí `false` (default behavior compares references)

- `p3 = p1` means `p3` and `p1` now refer to the **exact same object** in memory. So:
  - `p1 == p3` ‚Üí `true`
  - `p1.Equals(p3)` ‚Üí `true`

This clearly shows how **reference comparison** works in C#. Two objects may have the same data, but unless they are the same object, both `==` and `.Equals()` return `false`.

### Strings ‚Äì A Special Case

```
string s1 = "hello";
string s2 = "hello";

Console.WriteLine(s1 == s2);        // True
Console.WriteLine(s1.Equals(s2));   // True
```

Strings are a bit of a special case in .NET. They override both `==` and `.Equals()` to compare the **text content**, not just references. So, even if the two strings are different objects, they return `true` if the characters are the same.

---

### Custom Class with Overridden `.Equals()`

```
class Person {
    public string Name;

    public override bool Equals(object obj) {
        if (obj == null || GetType() != obj.GetType()) return false;
        Person other = (Person)obj;
        return Name == other.Name;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode() => Name.GetHashCode();
}

Person p1 = new Person { Name = "Alice" };
Person p2 = new Person { Name = "Alice" };

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2);        // False ‚Äì still reference comparison
Console.WriteLine(p1.Equals(p2));   // True ‚Äì now compares the Name field
```

In this example, we override `.Equals()` to compare the **contents** of the `Person` object (specifically the `Name` property). Now `.Equals()` returns `true` because the data is the same, even though the objects are different. But `==` still checks for reference equality.

---

### Custom Class with Overloaded `==` Operator

```
class Person {
    public string Name;

    public override bool Equals(object obj) =>
        obj is Person other && Name == other.Name;

    public override int GetHashCode() => Name.GetHashCode();

    public static bool operator ==(Person a, Person b) {
        if (ReferenceEquals(a, b)) return true;
        if (a is null || b is null) return false;
        return a.Name == b.Name;
    }

    public static bool operator !=(Person a, Person b) => !(a == b);
}

Person p1 = new Person { Name = "Alice" };
Person p2 = new Person { Name = "Alice" };

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2);        // True ‚Äì now compares value (Name)
Console.WriteLine(p1.Equals(p2));   // True ‚Äì also compares value
```

Here, we've overloaded the `==` operator so that it now compares the **content** of the object rather than just the reference. With this, both `==` and `.Equals()` behave consistently and return `true` if the data is the same.

- `==` and `.Equals()` **can return the same result**, but they don‚Äôt always ‚Äî it depends on the type being compared.
- For **value types**, both compare actual values by default.
- For **reference types**, both compare references unless:
  - `.Equals()` is **overridden**, or
  - `==` is **overloaded**.
- You can safely use `==` with `null`, but calling `.Equals()` on a `null` object causes a crash.
- **Strings**, `DateTime`, and a few other types override both to do value-based comparison.
- If you're building your own class and want value-based comparison:
  - Override `.Equals()` and `GetHashCode()`.
  - Optionally, also overload `==` and `!=` for consistency.

# üîÅ `ref`, `out`, and `in` in C#

In C#, variables are passed by **value** by default. This means that a **copy** of the variable is sent to a method ‚Äî and changes made inside the method **don‚Äôt affect** the original variable.

However, when you want to pass variables **by reference**, allowing the method to access or modify the original variable directly, you can use the keywords: `ref`, `out`, or `in`.

While all three pass data **by reference**, they each serve different purposes, follow different rules, and are used in different scenarios.

---

## ‚úÖ `ref` Keyword

### üîπ What it does

- Passes a variable **by reference**.
- The method can **read and modify** the variable.
- The variable **must be initialized** before it is passed.
- Both the **caller** and the **method** must use the `ref` keyword.

### üîπ When to use

- You want to **change** the value of a variable from inside a method.
- You want to **avoid copying** large structs by passing a reference.

### üîπ Example

```
void AddTen(ref int number) {
    number += 10;
}

int x = 5;
AddTen(ref x);
Console.WriteLine(x);  // Output: 15
```

---

## ‚úÖ `out` Keyword

### üîπ What it does

- Passes a variable **by reference**.
- The method is expected to **assign a value** to the variable.
- The variable **does not need to be initialized** before being passed.
- The method **must assign** a value before it returns.

### üîπ When to use

- You want to **return multiple values** from a method.
- You want to **output a result** or a **status flag + value** (e.g., `TryParse` pattern).

### üîπ Example

```
void GetCoordinates(out int x, out int y) {
    x = 10;
    y = 20;
}

int a, b;
GetCoordinates(out a, out b);
Console.WriteLine($"{a}, {b}");  // Output: 10, 20
```

---

## ‚úÖ `in` Keyword

### üîπ What it does

- Passes a variable **by reference**, but as **readonly**.
- The method can **read** the value but **cannot modify** it.
- The variable **must be initialized** before being passed.
- Improves **performance** by avoiding copies of large structs.

### üîπ When to use

- You want to pass a **large struct efficiently** without copying.
- You want to ensure the method **cannot accidentally modify** the value.

### üîπ Example

```
void Print(in int value) {
    Console.WriteLine(value);
    // value = 10; ‚ùå Error: Cannot assign to 'value' because it is a readonly parameter
}

int num = 42;
Print(in num);
```

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Use **`ref`** when the method needs to **read and modify** the caller‚Äôs variable.
- Use **`out`** when the method **only needs to assign** and return a value.
- Use **`in`** to **pass large structs efficiently** and ensure the value **cannot be modified**.
- All three are **explicit**: you must mark them both in the method signature and the method call.
- These keywords are **not allowed in async methods**.
- Modern C# also offers **tuples** as an alternative to `out` for returning multiple values in a more readable way.
